# NJ25 — Creator × Advertiser Collaboration Platform

**NJ25** is a collaboration platform designed to connect content creators (influencers) with advertisers for paid brand campaigns in a structured, transparent, and scalable way.

The platform focuses on solving real problems in influencer marketing:

- scattered communication
- unclear deliverables
- delayed payments
- lack of trust between creators and advertisers

---

## What Problem Does NJ25 Solve?

Influencer marketing today often relies on:

- direct messages and emails
- spreadsheets for tracking campaigns
- manual submission reviews
- payment follow-ups and disputes

NJ25 replaces this fragmented workflow with a **clear, state-driven collaboration system** where every action is explicit, traceable, and auditable.

---

## Core Idea

NJ25 is built around **workflow-driven collaboration**:

1. Advertisers create campaigns with defined budgets, deliverables, and available slots.
2. Creators apply to campaigns transparently.
3. Applications are reviewed and approved with budget reservation.
4. Creators submit proof of completed work.
5. Submissions are reviewed and approved.
6. Approved work results in wallet credit and payout eligibility.

Each stage has:

- a clear owner
- a defined status
- a deterministic outcome

This ensures fairness, accountability, and clarity for all participants.

## Design Philosophy

NJ25 prioritizes:

- explicit state transitions over implicit assumptions
- auditability over convenience
- simplicity in the MVP with room for future automation
- manual verification where trust is critical

The platform is intentionally built to scale from a manually managed MVP to a fully automated marketplace without fundamental redesign.

## Status

NJ25 is currently in active development as an MVP, with a focus on correctness, maintainability, and real-world workflows rather than shortcuts or demos.
